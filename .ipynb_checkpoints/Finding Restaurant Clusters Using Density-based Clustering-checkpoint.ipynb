    "Prospecting a successful retail location requires a thorough understanding of where people shop, dine, and linger for entertainment in a study area. One useful way to start making sense of the vast quantities of retail business information and start finding the locations that matter is to use spatial clustering to find locations with a dense retail presence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example starts with retail business data in Pittsburgh, PA and leverages a Spatial Statistics tool in ArcGIS named [Density-based Clustering](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/densitybasedclustering.htm) to separate the dense retail location data into clusters and noise. These clusters can then be the target of further analysis and potential decisions for your organization. "
