    "Prospecting a successful retail location requires a thorough understanding of where people shop, dine, and linger for entertainment in a study area. One useful way to start making sense of the vast quantities of retail business information and start finding the locations that matter is to use spatial clustering to find locations with a dense retail presence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example starts with retail business data in Pittsburgh, PA and leverages a Spatial Statistics tool in ArcGIS named [Density-based Clustering](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/densitybasedclustering.htm) to separate the dense retail location data into clusters and noise. These clusters can then be the target of further analysis and potential decisions for your organization. "

The DBSCAN algorithm is the fastest of the clustering methods, but is only appropriate if there is a very clear Search Distance to use, and that works well for all potential clusters. This requires that all meaningful clusters have similar densities.\n",

    "- _Multi-scale (OPTICS)_ — Uses the distance between neighboring features to create a reachability plot which is then used to separate clusters of varying densities from noise. The OPTICS algorithm offers the most flexibility in fine-tuning the clusters that are detected, though it is computationally intensive, particularly with a large Search Distance."
